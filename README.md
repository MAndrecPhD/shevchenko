This is a TEI encoding of the poetry of Taras Shevchenko originally written in the Ukrainian language for purposes of text analytics and other digital humanities approaches. The text is taken from the site http://litopys.org.ua/shevchenko/shev.htm.

It is currently not conformant to TEI specifications, as it lacks the proper header information.

The goal is to provide markup at the level of poems, sections, stanzas, and dialog. There are currently no plans to include visual formatting (e.g. line indentation) or any lower-level markup.
